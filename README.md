# Deshboard APIs

This repository contains the contracts for Deshboard APIs (both public and private) in the form of
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) (version 3),
which is Google's Interface Definition Language (IDL).

The main specialty of protobuf is that using the same definition
it's quite easy to create APIs supporting both REST and gRPC protocols.


## Versioning

Versioning tries to follow Google's versioning model of APIs:

- Alpha versions are highly subject of change
- Beta versions are being tested actively
- Stable versions are production ready (new versions are released upon BC break)
